0.2.1

* [M] Changed default key to Tab.
* [M] Moved QuickText.ini from \QuickText.ini to \plugins\Config\QuickText.ini
* [M] Increased substitution text length (max is 8bytes number of chars)
* [+] Valid tag keys (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890_-)
* [+] Global tag added. Current language tag takes priority over Global tag
* [M] bigger and friendlier logic for inputting tag/subtitution
* [M] fixed tab indenting of HTML UL tag under UNIX format


todo:

*************************************************
$ _$;
public $ $ {
get { return _$; }
set { _$ = value; }
}

Result (for example):

int _Abc;
public int Abc {
get { return _Abc; }
set { _Abc = value; }
}

Repeated values are "int" and "Abc" here. This is enough of information.
So, I propose to implement something like this:

$1 _$2;
public $1 $2 {
get { return _$2; }
set { _$2 = value; }
}

**************************************************************
ListMembers feature of intellisense in Visual studio
basically autocomplete for keywords.
