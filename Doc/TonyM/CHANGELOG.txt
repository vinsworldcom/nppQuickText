v 0.2.2 mod v2 (2010-06-01)
========================================================================================================================
Added:
	+ 	Config file: QuickText.conf.ini with following options:
		+ allowedChars	-	characters which are valid for tags (snippets names).
		+ lang_menu		-	Languages (separated by ",") occurring in plugin "Options..." dialog
							(GUI for editing snippets).

	+	"Open Tags File" command in plugin menu
	+	"Open Config File" command in plugin menu
	+	Default shortcut combo (ctrl + shift + F5) for "Refresh Configuration" command
	+	Sources package
		
Changed:
	*	Tags auto-completion appears even without any character inserted. Only need to push shortcut key combo
		(default ctrl + ENTER)
	
	*	Sources cleanup + some descriptive comments
	*	GLOBAL group now has number "255" irrespective of number of supported (by notepad++) languages and
		"lang_menu" (in QuickText.conf.ini) values.

Fixed:
	*	Tags auto-completion with GLOBAL group, so on the list are now tags from current language group and GLOBAL GROUP.
	*	Newline translation in "Options..." dialog (was dependent on current file settings, which was incorrect).
		CRLF has to be used in QuickText.ini file now, to translate newline correctly in "Options..." dialog.
	
Removed:
	-	Many unused files from sources package.
	-	Support for ANSI version

v 0.2.2 mod v1 (2010-05-03)
========================================================================================================================
Added:
	+ 	"._-" to allowed characters for tag names (it should be configurable btw, but I didn't have a time for playing 
		with this)
		
	+	"Refresh Configuration" command in plugin menu (it was commented out in sources), which reloads configuration
		file
		
Changed:
	*	default shortcut key to ctrl + enter (it can be changed to anything else besides tab)
	*	behavior of hotspots (it was broken), I don't know how to explain this changes – just test it

Fixed:
	*	tags auto-completion and change its behavior, so on the list are now only tags which begins with typed part
		(originally on the list was tags which contains typed part in any place)
		
Removed:
	-	Ability to use tab as shortcut key, because of many related with it bugs
