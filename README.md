## Description

QuickText is a Notepad++ plugin for quick text substitution, including
multi field inputs. It's similar to Tab Triggers in TextMate.

## Build

I compiled with MS Visual Studio Community 2017 and this seems to work OK.

For 32-bit:

    [x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017]

```
    C:\> set Configuration=Release
    C:\> set Platform=x86
    C:\> msbuild
```

For 64-bit:

    [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017]

```
    C:\> set Configuration=Release
    C:\> set Platform=x64
    C:\> msbuild
```

## Installation

Copy the:
+ 32-bit: ./bin/QuickText.dll
+ 64-bit: ./bin64/QuickText.dll

to the Notepad++ plugins folder:
+ In N++ <7.6, directly in the plugins/ folder
+ In N++ >=7.6, in a directory called QuickText in the plugins/ folder (plugins/QuickText/)

**NOTE:**  The original version put config files in weird places and with
           no updates since the Notepad++ 7.6 new plugins architecture, it's
           gotten worse.  This version corrects this.  You'll need to put
           the following files (or your existing versions) in their 
           respective directory locations:

    Config/QuickText.conf.default.ini = NPP_INSTALL_DIR/plugins/Config/QuickText.conf.ini
    Config/QuickText.default.ini      = NPP_INSTALL_DIR/plugins/Config/QuickText.ini

## Usage

Assign a shortcut key to the Plugins => QuickText => Replace Tag menu to 
use QuickText tags from within the current Notepad++ document.

If the Replace Tag hotkey is used and there is no text before it or
no valid expansion for the text before it, the Replace Tag hotkey
character is inserted.  For example, using "Tab" as the key with
no valid expansion just inserts a tab (as if Tab key press).

Once a Tag is inserted, you can use the Replace Tag hotkey again and 
again to navigate through the hotspots in the inserted Tag snippet.

**NOTE:**  Tab can now be used again as the Replace Tag hotkey.
           There is no default.

## Customization

Settings:

Use to configure Tags for languages.
+ **Use Scintilla Autocomplete**: uses Scintilla autocomplete while typing to 
  suggest tags for the current language.  Without this enabled, you need to 
  trigger the Replace Tag hotkey to get the autocomplete list or just type 
  a Tag from memory.
+ **Auto Insert Autocomplete**: when a tag is completed from a Scintilla 
  autocompletion, expand the tag.  Without this enabled, you need to trigger 
  the Replace Tag hotkey again to expand the Tag.

To make you're own tags:

+ Tags file (QuickText.ini) *MUST* use "Windows (CR LF)" line endings.
+ First make sure the tag's Language Section already exists. This is 
  done by creating a new section with the code corresponding to the 
  Language.  See LANGUAGE CODES.
+ Then, for the key of the tag, use only lower/upper case and numbers.
+ Special chars:
  + $ hotspots
  + \\$ for writing actual '$'
  + \n break line.

Or just use the Options GUI.

## Example

8 is the Language Code for HTML
